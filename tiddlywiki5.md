# Re:TiddlyWiki 5

My plugins for [TiddlyWiki&nbsp;5](https://www.tiddlywiki.com) (a unique non-linear
notebook for capturing, organising and sharing complex information). These
plugins extend your TiddlyWikis with new functionality:

- fonts
- video player functionality and theming
- TiddlyWiki&nsp;5 plugin development

## Fonts

Add fonts and icons to your TiddlyWikis without the need to install them first
into your system, or a permanent Internet connection.

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [TW5FontAwesome](http://thediveo.github.io/TW5FontAwesome) | Brings [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com) to your TiddlyWikis, without local font installs or the need for an Internet connection. |
| [TWRoboto](http://thediveo.github.io/TWRoboto) | Brings Google's Roboto font family to your TiddlyWikis, without local font installs or the need for an Internet connection. |

## Video

There's more to TiddlyWikis than just text and static images. Add an enhances
HTML5 video player!

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [TwTube](http://thediveo.github.io/TwTube) | Turns your TiddlyWiki into your personal non-linear tube uing the [Video.js media player](https://videojs.com/). There are several skins and some feature plugins available, too. |

## Plugin Development

This is from the eat-your-own-dog-food department.

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [TiddlyWikiPluginSkeleton](http://thediveo.github.io/TiddlyWikiPluginSkeleton) | TW5 plugin skeleton project to start from when developing using the _ThirdFlow_. This is usually the starting point, so there's no need in cloning the _ThirdFlow_ repo, but instead clone this repository. See the project's instructions (video, text) for details. |
| [ThirdFlow](http://thediveo.github.io/ThirdFlow) | Helps with developing TiddlyWiki plugins: it neatly organizes your tiddlers for perfect source code management, packages your plugins, and generates live demo Wikis. |
