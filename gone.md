# Re:Go-ing Nowhere

Go packages:

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [ASCII tree](https://github.com/TheDiveO/go-asciitree) | [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/go-asciitree?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/go-asciitree) Pretty-print tree-like data structures in ASCII and Unicode. The package also supports properties of nodes, separate from the tree hierarchy, as well as tagging `struct` fields with their roles. |
| [klo](https://github.com/TheDiveO/klo) | [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/klo?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/klo) a Go package for `kubectl`-like output of Go values (such as structs, maps, et cetera) in several output formats. You might want to use this package in your CLI tools to easily offer `kubectl`-like output formatting to your Kubernetes-spoiled users. |
| [gons](https://github.com/TheDiveO/gons) | [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/gons?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/TheDiveO/gons)  small Go package that selectively switches your Go application into other already existing Linux namespaces. This must happen before the Go runtime spins up, blocking certain namespace changes, such as changing into a different mount namespace. |
